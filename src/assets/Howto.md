## What this app can do
This app demonstrates how Dash can be used to annotate and classify areas in an image. You can:
- freehand draw rectangles to highlight areas of the image
- classify the highlighted areas with a label
- see the information on highlighted areas in an interactive table
- select different images to annotate
- export the annotations you have made

## How to use this app
To annotate the image, first select the annotation label you want to apply:

Then draw a rectangle on the image area you want to annotate with your cursor:

You can continue annotating additional areas of the image, selecting a different image with the `previous` and `next`
buttons, or you can download the annotations and use them to train an image content classifier:
